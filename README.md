Repo for Module 2 Challenge (Nick Bartram)

This is my submission for the Module 2 Challenge - "Multiple_year_stock_data"

Included in this folder:

    - Screenshots from each Quarter (4x .png files: "Q1-4_screenshot")

    - VBA script files (1x .bas file: "Mod2_challenge_NickB.bas")

    - This README file

- Open the screenshots to view results
    - Results are viewable in .png files (Q1_screenshot.png, Q2_screenshot.png, ...)
    - .png files are viewable in most browsers or image viewers

- Use the .bas, .vb, or .vba files to test the code on a blank "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" file
    - Open a fresh "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" file
    - Import "Mod2_challenge_NickB.bas" into a blank Module
    - Run the Macro
    - View results
    - NOTE: the folder contains identical files with VBA script but, different file extensions
    - There was some confusion in class about which file extension to use
    - I've included three different ones, hoping at least one of them is the correct one

- Note on Code Sourcing:
    - I used the Xpert Learning Assistant liberally while creating this code
    - Some of the code may be very close to identical to answers the Xpert Learning Assistant might give
    - Otherwise I did not view code from other students, nor take directly from any websites (I don't believe).
    - It's possible I did view some Google search results, but mostly only for broad concepts. If I've forgotten to cite a major source I apologize.

- Thank you!
